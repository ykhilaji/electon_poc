This repository contains code and related materials for [Building Electron.js apps with javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-lBH8I52J-3nEhEQD6_nDs6) course.

## Project description

This is a simple Electron.js application that allows users to stream videos from multiple services (e.g. Youtube and Crunchyroll).  
It uses [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) and [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) to scrape the data; [bulma](http://bulma.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS), [video.js](http://videojs.com/) to build the UI.  
Electron.js is tested using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron).
[electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) is used for deployment.
